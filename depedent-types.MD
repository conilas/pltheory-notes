The idea for this small article is to bring the idea of dependent type theory to the table. I will not extend the piece in the math of it, because [1] covers it way better than I could.

# Naming

One of the things I was having a bad time to understand was the *naming* for the concept. The thing is: **dependent type theory** is just a way to call **Martin-LÃ¶f type theory**, which is also known as **intuitionisc** type theory. So I'll try to use them interchangeably in order to get used to it.
