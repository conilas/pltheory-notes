An attempt at making sense out of "real" things even when and where everything is _in fact_ "virtual". This would be, maybe, the opposit of "actualism". Or idk, this might also make no sense at all. The one who is reading decides. BUT! This post will take you on a space trip, coming out of programming (a tiny little blockchain for the buzzword count with a take on smart contracts, then going through Pre/Post conditions and Hoare logic/Dijkstra weakest precondition of something, touching some separation logic then simply transporting away to the abstraction that is modal logic and concretelly walking towards dynamic logic. All of that so we can understand a bit of the idea of actualism, necessity and contingency, just the bare minimum, enough to jump to hegel. In fact, if we had to, we could even hand over to deleuze for the virtuallity and actuality, but let's leave it like this for now).

1. Smart contracts
  - The worse-then-science-pop-culture explanation of a block chain
  - The role of smart contracts
  - Smart contracts languages and it's feature that strongly imposes difference from current industrial programming
3. Hoare Logic and the goto guy
  - Pre/Post conditions and Dijkstra's role in all of it 
4. Separation logic as some possible future
5. Modal logic
  - The possible and the necessary
5. Dynamic logic
  - Using the necessary and the possibility in a future sense
6. Actuallity, necessity, contingency: what is actualism
  - "Bare necessities, just the bare necessities"
  - Actualism
7. Here comes hegel as observed from the second subject who is necessary in the dialectical process
  - Žižek "Necessity as self-sublated contingency" on Hegel
  - Understanding that view by understanding the new phisolophy :tm:
