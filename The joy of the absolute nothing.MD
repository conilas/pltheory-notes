## The joy of the absolute nothing

The spectro duck went ahead after all of its past and got a beer. Explosion, coca cola!

HAHA! jokes. I spent 5 minutes thinking on which punctuation to use after the laugh. But i'm seriously fun or, as they claim; the encarnation of the oximoron.

The weird people that make computer go bip bop, the ones apart from us who play with meshing random foss stuff together and go home happy to drink a beer - they have their jokes too!

If you are asking "oh, am I supposed to read all of them?", I have the answer. Of course not! Just decorate the titles so you can be pretensious around your friends talking about your higyenic macro system with scope sets (btw, have you read that? it's fun - https://typesanitizer.com/blog/scope-sets-as-pinata.html, but it's not on this list. maybe it should be?)

LET US BEGIN WITH THE CLASSIC NUMBER 1:

```
Go To Statement Considered Harmful
```

... said no one c hardcode ultrabush megablaster rockstar 10xer evah!! Nah, I'm playing. But this one has a funny store behind it. 

When Dijkstra sent this paper out, THE DUDE from the 60~70s (idk) himself was there. NIKLAUS WRITH, YES! If you went through game hacking around the years 2010-2014 in the web (or maybe some other time; I recall this one), then you may have played around with Delphi 7 or VB (.net iirc?). For those who were lucky to play in the marvelous playground we had for delphi (was delphi a language classified as a descendant of pascal? or whas it simply RAD?), you will be happy to know that this guy is involved with that. I could not code sh*t back at that time, just copy/pasted stuff around and did not even begin to understand what was happening. If there was a variable with some wrong identifier, it would take me 5 minutes to find it. BUT NOT THIS GUY! He has some dope stuff - I believe he was in the Algol pannel, came up with Algol W, etc. Pascal was one of the free big open source languages with some form of bootstrapping (compilers compiling compilers :tm:). 

Anyway, I derailed a lot. Let me take a breath.

Now for the interesting part: Dijkstra initially sent his paper entitled as "A Case Against the Goto Statement". The fella I mentioned before probably jumped and yelled "NO! let's get more media, make it like the met gala" or something and proposed a more profound and hurtful, the famous "Go to statement considered harmful". Easy like that, it was a blast! 

I mean, wikipedia has some strong opinions on that. They claim "[...] The 1970s and 1980s saw a decline in the use of GOTO". There's not much data for that claim, but I make an even more strong point by saying that the usage of it has almost gone extinct with the last, say, few years and some events?

It's always fun to think about "what is next"; but you can always find some space for "what was not". Take Lucid, the dataflow programming language. Concept? Fun! Makes sense? Yes! Did it take off? .... (well, people can argue about the relation on VHDL, fpgas, whatever to dataflow programming, so keep that in mind). 

**THIS MIGHT BE FAKE NEWS**: I somehow remember one paper on a language called something of the likes of "Absyss". They claimed to be the first logic language, pre-prolog and so on. You seem where this might go: I kid you not, the guys wrote a paper butthurt because the other people cut their way. I wish I could find this paper, and I will go on this quest someday. Otherwise I write a fake one.

GOTO: `Go To Statement Considered Harmful 2`

```
Go To Statement Considered Harmful 2
```

Now, for some extra sparkles on it. Guess who was against being against GOTO? Linus Torvalds. REFLECT ON THAT HOWEVER YOU WANT. Seriously, any side. Does this mean, since he is a kernel genius, the one and only real 10xer c developer, he might be right? Afterall, he just claimed that the absolutism in that sentence can be counter-productive.

Somebody could say something like "what about the guy who finds himself in a triple nested for loop? HA - GOT YOU!" - they want a freaking workaround in the language to be just like how all of our programs are composed of. We are terrible developers. And after that they claim that this form of expressive list manipulations (list expressions) is just showoff crap. Maybe it is. They made the kernel, not you.

But, OTOH, we have Dikstra; you've probably seem something about 'oh, take the shortest path here'. Now you can play with the signifying chain and say 'oh, I will make use of the Dijkstra's algorithm to make it there and so I will, in optimal time`. He's fire is what I mean here. Niklaus writh, the guy from above, delivered a manual of Pascal that advices against the use of goto. 

Amazing fight. Who won?

Hehehe. It goes on! It continues (save this for the pun later). This right here has some of the opinions on why considering goto statements harmful is considered hamrful. http://web.archive.org/web/20090320002214/http://www.ecn.purdue.edu/ParaMount/papers/rubin87goto.pdf. Again, I just wanted to share the titles!
